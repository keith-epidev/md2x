I would like to share my sincere gratitude to Professor Robert Ross, my primary supervisor whom has given me so much creative control. Robert has provided constant assistance. He also has bestowed me with his precious technical expertise. Adam Console my co-supervisor, has helped steer this project in the right direction on numerous occasions. It was Adam that suggested the delta machine design. His diverse knowledge is irreplaceable.

The RepRap community has paved the way for projects like this. There is a wealth of freely available information on their website and forums. I hope that I will be able to express my appreciation by giving something back to the open source community.

I would like to personally thank everyone who has supported me. I have discussed this project with many of my friends and family, who have contributed with valuable support and feedback.

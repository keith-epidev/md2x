This document describes the project plan for an inexpensive 3D printer. The project is developed for the final year engineering project at La Trobe University by Keith Brown.

The printer will be in the form of a delta machine. The intention is to reduce the number of components and utilise cheaper hardware while still achieving a fast accurate print. The electronics will not be a direct derivative of current implementations. Experimentation with alternative architecture will be trialled with the goal of delivering a more computational capable system.

An introduction into 3D Printing and its concepts, advantages and issues is outlined. The commercial viability for both commercial and consumer markets is described. This projects primary, secondary and tertiary objectives are listed. The strategies to achieve these goals is also described, followed by budget requirements and lastly a detailed schedule is included.
